## My process

I wanted to start from the mobile design and scale up because that seems easier but was given a desktop layout design. So it ended up being the desktop that was designed first.

- Went with a top down approach
- Had some issues around utilizing css background images
- For adjusting layout to size worked greatest width to smallest width. Trying to adjust only at certain breakpoints
- Some fonts used at smaller sizes are not ideal

### Built with

- CSS
- HTML5
- Flexbox
- @media

### What I learned

Learned to get better at using `@media` for making page responsive to different sizes, and how to better organize that within my css, well perhaps that last part is still questionable. Still need to improve organizing my code... At the end it was feeling more and more disorganized. May have been easier if I was working from a mobile to desktop layout.

Don't be afraid to use `px` for sizing images but for sizing fonts you should use `em` or `rem` and elements such as margin, padding, etc... will likely need similar relative sizing.

### Continued development

- Start from mobile
- Try mixing `em` and `rem` in next project
- Continue working with `@media`
- Look for ways to better organize css
- Think about accessibility and inclusion
